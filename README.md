# My Kaggle Notebooks

I joined Kaggle in October 2021. Since then, I wrote many notebooks in R and Python and began to play on some competitions.

One of my favorites is the [Greg Kaggle Metabook]( https://www.kaggle.com/code/gregoryoliveira/greg-kaggle-metabook). Using Meta Kaggle and some scraping, I wrote a notebook that summarize some selected notebooks and my most upvote works. This notebook is scheduled to run one a week.

You can see all of them at [my profile](https://www.kaggle.com/gregoryoliveira). You can also reach me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gregory-melo-72ab5bb0/) or direct by [e-mail](gregoryomelo@gmail.com).
