# My Kaggle Notebooks

I joined Kaggle in October 2021. Since then, I wrote many notebooks in R and Python and began to play on some competitions.

One of my favorites is the [Greg Kaggle Metabook]( https://www.kaggle.com/code/gregoryoliveira/greg-kaggle-metabook). Using Meta Kaggle and some scraping, I wrote a notebook that summarize some selected notebooks and my most upvote works. This notebook is scheduled to run one a week.

Another notebook that I like is [Brazil Climate Change - Part III - Stations EDA](https://www.kaggle.com/code/gregoryoliveira/brazil-climate-change-part-iii-stations-eda). This kernel began with an isolated notebook that collect and processed data from [INMET (National Institute of Meteorology - Instituto Nacional de Meteorologia)](https://portal.inmet.gov.br/dadoshistoricos) repository. In this first step, data is stored as a [Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gregoryoliveira/brazil-weather-information-by-inmet/). I used some data visualization tools in [Brazil Climate Change - Part III - Stations EDA](https://www.kaggle.com/code/gregoryoliveira/brazil-climate-change-part-iii-stations-eda) to get a better picture of data quality and then fill the missing values using [IterativeImputer](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.impute.IterativeImputer.html#sklearn.impute.IterativeImputer) from scikit-learn.

You can see all of them at [my profile](https://www.kaggle.com/gregoryoliveira). You can also reach me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gregory-melo-72ab5bb0/) or direct by [e-mail](gregoryomelo@gmail.com).
